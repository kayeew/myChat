# Client/Server Chat
MyChat is a simple multithreaded client/server chat system where the server can accept multiple clients simultaneously and serves them. When the client sends a message, it is sent to the server and then broadcasted to all clients connected to the server.

### Setup:
1. Open NetBeans IDE
2. Open project
3. Check myChatClient.java for correct IP address[its localhost by default]
4. Run myChatServer and start server
5. Run myChatClient, enter username and connect.
6. Repeat step 5 for more clients.
7. Start chatting.
